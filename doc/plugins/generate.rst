Generate Plugins
================

TODO: Come up with a use case for Generate plugins that doesn't overlap with Command,
Brush Shape, or Brush Mode plugins. Rename these plugins to avoid confusion with "Chunk
Generation". See `hilbert.py`, `koch.py`, and `city.py` in the `plugins` folder for examples.
